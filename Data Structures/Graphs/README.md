## Graphs

### Introduction
Graphs consist of vertices and edges.

### Types
- **Directed**: Edges have direction.
- **Undirected**: Bidirectional edges.
- **Weighted**: Edges with weights.

### Representation
- Adjacency list/matrix.

### Operations
- Add vertex/edge.
- Traversal: DFS, BFS.

### Advantages
- Model relations.

### Disadvantages
- Complex storage.

### Applications
- Social networks.
- Maps (shortest path).

### Time Complexities
- Traversal: O(V+E)
