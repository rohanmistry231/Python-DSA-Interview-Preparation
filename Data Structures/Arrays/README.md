## Arrays

### Introduction
Arrays are fixed-size, contiguous data structures storing elements of the same type, accessed by index.

### Operations
- Access: O(1)
- Insert/Delete: O(n) (shifting required)
- Search: O(n) for unsorted, O(log n) for sorted (binary search)

### Advantages
- Fast access by index.
- Memory efficient.

### Disadvantages
- Fixed size.
- Costly insertions/deletions.

### Applications
- Storing lists of data.
- Lookup tables.
- Matrix operations.

### Time Complexities
- Access: O(1)
- Insert/Delete: O(n)
- Search: O(n) or O(log n) if sorted
