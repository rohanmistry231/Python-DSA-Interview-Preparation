## Stacks

### Introduction
Stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure. Operations: push (add), pop (remove), peek (top element).

### Implementation
- Using arrays or linked lists.
- Python: Use list with append/pop.

### Operations
- Push: O(1)
- Pop: O(1)
- Peek: O(1)
- Is Empty: O(1)

### Advantages
- Simple.
- Fast operations.

### Disadvantages
- Fixed size if array-based (unless dynamic).

### Applications
- Function calls (recursion).
- Undo/redo.
- Expression evaluation.

### Time Complexities
- All basic ops: O(1)
