## Trees

### Introduction
Trees are hierarchical structures with nodes; root at top.

### Types
- **Binary Tree**: Max 2 children.
- **BST**: Left < root < right.
- **AVL**: Balanced BST (height diff <=1).
- **Heap**: Complete binary tree; min/max property.

### Operations
- Insert/Delete/Search: O(log n) for balanced.
- Traversal: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level.

### Advantages
- Sorted data in BST.
- Priority in heaps.

### Disadvantages
- Unbalanced can be O(n).

### Applications
- File systems.
- Databases (indexes).
- Priority queues.

### Time Complexities
- Balanced: O(log n)
