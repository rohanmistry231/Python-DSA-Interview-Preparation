## Recursion and Backtracking

### Introduction
Recursion: Function calls itself. Backtracking: Builds solution incrementally, abandons invalid paths.

### Key Concepts
- Base case to stop recursion.
- Backtracking for combinatorial problems.

### Advantages
- Elegant for tree-like problems.

### Disadvantages
- Stack overflow risk, inefficient without memo.

### Applications
- Factorial, subsets, permutations.

### Time Complexities
- Exponential without optimization.
