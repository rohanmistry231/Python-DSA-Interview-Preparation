## Bit Manipulation

### Introduction
Operations on binary bits.

### Key Operations
- AND, OR, XOR, shifts, masks.

### Advantages
- Fast, space-efficient.

### Disadvantages
- Low-level, error-prone.

### Applications
- Flags, compression.

### Time Complexities
- O(1) or O(log n).
